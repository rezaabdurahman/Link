# Database Monitoring Implementation Summary

## üéØ Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive, production-ready database performance monitoring system for the Link application. This system provides unified monitoring across all backend services with service-specific tuning, real-time alerting, and integrated error reporting.

## üöÄ What We Built

### 1. Unified Monitoring Library (`backend/shared/database/monitoring/`)
- **Core Engine**: `instrumentation.go` - Main monitoring logic with GORM and pgx support
- **Sentry Integration**: `sentry.go` - Enhanced error reporting with sanitized context
- **Documentation**: `README.md` - Comprehensive usage and deployment guide

#### Key Features:
- Multi-database support (GORM for PostgreSQL/PostGIS/pgvector, pgx for connection pools)
- Prometheus metrics with proper labels and histograms
- Automatic query sanitization for security
- Service-specific performance thresholds
- Real-time connection pool monitoring
- Transaction tracking and error categorization

### 2. Service Integrations

#### User Service (`backend/user-svc/`)
- **Database**: GORM with PostgreSQL
- **Threshold**: 50ms (fast user operations required)
- **Features**: User profile queries, session management, friend relationships
- **Integration**: Updated `internal/config/database.go` with monitoring plugins

#### Location Service (`backend/location-svc/`)
- **Database**: GORM with PostGIS
- **Threshold**: 200ms (spatial queries are computationally complex)
- **Features**: Geographic queries, proximity detection, location updates
- **Integration**: Spatial-query-aware monitoring with higher thresholds

#### Search Service (`backend/search-svc/`)
- **Database**: GORM with pgvector
- **Threshold**: 500ms (vector similarity searches are compute-intensive)
- **Features**: Embedding storage, similarity search, content indexing
- **Integration**: Vector operation monitoring with appropriate timeouts

#### Chat Service (`backend/chat-svc/`)
- **Database**: pgx connection pool
- **Threshold**: 50ms (real-time messaging performance critical)
- **Features**: Message storage, real-time queries, channel management
- **Integration**: pgx-specific monitoring with enhanced query wrappers

### 3. Monitoring Infrastructure

#### Prometheus Alerting (`monitoring/alerting-rules/database-performance.yml`)
- **Critical Alerts**: Connection pool exhaustion, high error rates, SLO breaches
- **Warning Alerts**: Slow queries, high pool usage, performance degradation
- **Service-Specific**: Chat latency, vector query performance, PostGIS operations
- **SLO Monitoring**: Availability and latency compliance tracking

#### Grafana Dashboard (`monitoring/grafana/dashboards/database-performance.json`)
- **Overview Section**: Query rates, pool utilization, connection health
- **Performance Analysis**: Duration percentiles, slow query trends
- **Error Analysis**: Error rates by type, distribution visualization
- **Service-Specific**: Individual service performance deep-dive
- **SLO Tracking**: Real-time availability and latency monitoring

### 4. Deployment & Validation

#### Deployment Script (`scripts/deploy-database-monitoring-v2.sh`)
- Environment validation and dependency management
- Service integration verification
- Health checks and monitoring validation
- Comprehensive deployment checklist generation

#### Documentation & Guides
- **README.md**: Comprehensive technical documentation
- **Deployment Checklist**: Step-by-step integration guide
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and solutions

- **Transaction Failures**: Long-running transaction alerts

### Enhanced Context
- Service name and operation classification
- Sanitized SQL queries (parameters removed for security)
- Query duration and performance metrics
- Table names and affected row counts
- Error categorization (connection, timeout, constraint, etc.)
