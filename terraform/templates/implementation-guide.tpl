# Database Isolation Implementation Guide

Generated by Terraform on ${timestamp()}
Environment: ${environment}

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for implementing the database isolation strategy for Link services.

## Service Databases Created

%{ for service, config in services ~}
### ${service} Service
- **Database**: ${config.database_name}
- **User**: ${config.username}
- **Description**: ${config.description}

%{ endfor ~}

## Connection Usage Summary

${connection_summary.before_isolation}
${connection_summary.after_isolation}

**Connection Settings per Service**: ${connection_summary.max_connections_per_service}

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Database Setup Complete âœ…
The following databases and users have been created:
%{ for service, config in services ~}
- ${config.database_name} (${config.username})
%{ endfor ~}

### 2. Update Service Configurations
Update each service to use its dedicated database credentials.

### 3. Deploy Connection Pooling
Use the generated PgBouncer configuration for optimal connection management.

### 4. Backup Strategy
${backup_recommendations.backup_strategy}
- Retention: ${backup_recommendations.retention_days} days
- Schedule: ${backup_recommendations.backup_schedule}
- Testing: ${backup_recommendations.restore_testing}

## Next Steps

1. Test database connectivity for each service
2. Deploy PgBouncer with generated configuration
3. Update service deployment configurations
4. Set up monitoring and alerts
5. Configure automated backups
