### Consolidated Scripts
- Multiple terraform backup-restore scripts → Single script
- Multiple pre-commit setup scripts → Single script

### New Scripts Added
- `deploy-with-migrations.sh` → Automated deployment with migrations
- `rollback-migrations.sh` → Safe migration rollbacks

### Scripts Kept
- `deploy-database-monitoring.sh` → Current monitoring deployment
- `generate-secrets.sh` → Production secret generation
- `setup-db-isolation.sh` → Database security setup
- `setup-security-features.sh` → Security hardening

## Migration Commands Summary

### Legacy (Manual)
```bash
# Old way - manual migrations
cd backend/service && make migrate-up
```

### New (Automated)
```bash
# Production deployment with migrations
./scripts/deploy-with-migrations.sh --environment production

# Zero-downtime migrations
./backend/shared-libs/migrations/migrate -service=user-svc -action=safe-up

# Rollback if needed
./scripts/rollback-migrations.sh --service user-svc --steps 1
```

## Docker Compose Changes
- Added migration init containers to `docker-compose.production.yml`
- All services now depend on successful migrations
- Migrations run automatically before service startup

## CI/CD Integration
- GitHub Actions workflow validates all migrations
- Automated migration testing in CI
- Zero-downtime deployment pipeline
