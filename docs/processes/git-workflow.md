# Git Sync Workflow: Keeping Branches in Sync Before Merging

## üîç **Current Situation Analysis**

### **Your Current Branch:** `feat/chat-summary`
- Has extensive AI service work (backend/ai-svc/, docs/, frontend changes)
- Local master at commit: `a4d7cf0`
- Remote master at commit: `78f1afc` (newer)

### **Remote Master Changes:**
```bash
78f1afc - Merge pull request #7 from feat/search-extension
1610012 - Complete cleanup of deprecated search endpoints
46bec60 - feat: friend search in chat  
6d73e7d - Merge pull request #6 from feat/discovery-search-bar
a3d2605 - fix: increase lint warning threshold
```

**üìä Status:** Your branch is **8 commits behind** remote master

## üõ†Ô∏è **Safe Sync Workflow**

### **Option 1: Merge Strategy (Recommended for Feature Branches)**

```bash
# 1. Stage and commit your current work
git add .
git commit -m "feat: complete AI service implementation with documentation

- Add comprehensive AI service (backend/ai-svc/)
- Implement OpenAI integration with PII anonymization
- Add privacy consent management and GDPR compliance
- Create resilient chat service client with circuit breaker
- Add comprehensive test coverage (60%+ achieved)
- Update API gateway routing for AI endpoints
- Add frontend AI summary integration
- Create extensive documentation and release notes

# 2. Fetch latest changes from remote
git fetch origin

# 3. Merge remote master into your feature branch
git merge origin/master

# 4. Resolve any conflicts if they occur
# (We'll handle this step-by-step if conflicts arise)

# 5. Test that everything works after merge
# Run your tests, build, etc.

# 6. Push your updated feature branch
git push origin feat/chat-summary
```

### **Option 2: Rebase Strategy (For Linear History)**

```bash
# 1. Stage and commit your work first
git add .
git commit -m "feat: complete AI service implementation with documentation"

# 2. Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin

# 3. Interactive rebase onto latest master
git rebase -i origin/master

# 4. Resolve conflicts step by step
# 5. Push with force (careful!)
git push --force-with-lease origin feat/chat-summary
```

## ‚ö° **Step-by-Step Execution (Merge Strategy)**

### **Step 1: Commit Current Work**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: complete AI service implementation with documentation

- Add comprehensive AI service (backend/ai-svc/)
- Implement OpenAI integration with PII anonymization  
- Add privacy consent management and GDPR compliance
- Create resilient chat service client with circuit breaker
- Add comprehensive test coverage (60%+ achieved)
- Update API gateway routing for AI endpoints
- Add frontend AI summary integration
- Create extensive documentation and release notes

```

### **Step 2: Sync with Remote Master**
```bash
# Fetch all remote changes
git fetch origin

# Show what changes will be merged
git log --oneline --graph HEAD..origin/master

# Merge remote master into your branch
git merge origin/master
```

### **Step 3: Handle Potential Conflicts**

**Common Conflict Areas to Watch:**
- `go.work` and `go.work.sum` (workspace files)
- `README.md` (documentation updates)
- Frontend routing files
- API gateway configurations

**If conflicts occur:**
```bash
# Git will show files with conflicts
git status

# Edit each conflicted file manually
# Look for conflict markers: <<<<<<< ======= >>>>>>>

# After resolving conflicts:
git add <resolved-files>
git commit -m "merge: resolve conflicts with remote master"
```

### **Step 4: Verify Everything Works**
```bash
# Test backend builds
cd backend/ai-svc && go build ./cmd && cd ../..

# Test frontend builds  
cd frontend && npm run build && cd ..

# Run any existing tests
make test  # or your test command
```

### **Step 5: Push Updated Branch**
```bash
git push origin feat/chat-summary
```

## üîç **Conflict Resolution Examples**

### **Example 1: go.work Conflicts**
```go
// Conflict in go.work
<<<<<<< HEAD
./backend/ai-svc
./backend/api-gateway
./backend/chat-svc
=======
./backend/api-gateway
./backend/chat-svc
./backend/discovery-svc
./backend/user-svc
>>>>>>> origin/master

// Resolution: Include all services
./backend/ai-svc
./backend/api-gateway
./backend/chat-svc
./backend/discovery-svc
./backend/user-svc
```

### **Example 2: README.md Conflicts**
```markdown
<!-- Conflict in README.md -->
<<<<<<< HEAD
## Services
- ai-svc: AI processing and summarization
- api-gateway: API routing and authentication
=======
## Services  
- api-gateway: API routing and authentication
- discovery-svc: Friend discovery and search
>>>>>>> origin/master

<!-- Resolution: Merge both sections -->
## Services
- ai-svc: AI processing and summarization
- api-gateway: API routing and authentication
- discovery-svc: Friend discovery and search
```
