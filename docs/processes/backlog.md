## Task Management

### Priority Guidelines
- **High**: Critical bugs, security issues, blocking dependencies
- **Medium**: Feature development, documentation improvements, technical debt
- **Low**: Nice-to-have features, future enhancements, optimizations

### Status Definitions
- **Pending**: Not started, waiting for assignment
- **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- **Blocked**: Waiting for dependencies or external factors
- **Done**: Completed and verified

### Assignment Process
1. Tasks are assigned during sprint planning
2. Update status and assigned person when work begins
3. Move completed tasks to "Completed Tasks" section
4. Add new tasks at bottom of appropriate priority section

## Metrics & Progress

### Audit Resolution Summary
