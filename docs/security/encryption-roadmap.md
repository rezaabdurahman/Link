# Encryption Key Management Roadmap

## Overview

This document tracks the encryption key management system implementation and future roadmap for the Link platform.

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED)

**Status: ‚úÖ DEPLOYED**  
**Completion Date**: 2024 Q4  
**Risk Level**: ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ (Eliminated data loss risk)

### What Was Delivered
- [x] **Versioned Encryption Library** - `backend/shared-libs/encryption/encryption.go`
- [x] **Multi-Key Support** - Current + legacy keys for backward compatibility
- [x] **Version Header System** - Each encrypted field remembers its key version
- [x] **Safe Rotation Scripts** - `scripts/rotate-application-secrets.sh`
- [x] **Secrets Pipeline Integration** - AWS Secrets Manager + K8s External Secrets
- [x] **Monthly Automated Rotation** - Scheduled for 1st of each month
- [x] **Comprehensive Testing** - Unit tests + deployment verification
- [x] **Documentation** - Complete developer guides and troubleshooting

### Key Capabilities Enabled
```go
// Zero-risk encryption usage
encryptor, _ := encryption.NewServiceEncryptor()
encrypted, _ := encryptor.EncryptString("sensitive data")
decrypted, _ := encryptor.DecryptString(encrypted) // Works with any key version
```

```bash
# Zero-risk key rotation  
./scripts/rotate-application-secrets.sh production
# Result: All existing data still readable, new data uses new key
```

## üîÑ Phase 2: Migration & Monitoring (PLANNED - 6-12 months)

**Target Start**: 2024 Q4  
**Expected Completion**: 2025 Q2-Q3  
**Focus**: Operational excellence and optimization

### Data Migration Strategy

#### **2.1 Migration Analysis**
- [ ] **Audit Current Data** - Survey encrypted fields by key version
  ```sql
  -- Example analysis query
  SELECT 
    SUBSTRING(encrypted_email FROM 1 FOR 3) as version_prefix,
    COUNT(*) as record_count
  FROM users 
  WHERE encrypted_email IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY version_prefix;
  ```
- [ ] **Migration Planning** - Create rollout plan based on data volume
- [ ] **Risk Assessment** - Identify critical vs non-critical encrypted fields

#### **2.2 Background Migration Jobs**
- [ ] **Lazy Migration** - Re-encrypt during normal read operations
  ```go
  func (s *UserService) GetUser(id int) (*User, error) {
      user := s.fetchFromDB(id)
      
      // Check if email needs migration
      if version := s.encryptor.GetKeyVersion(user.Email); version < currentVersion {
          // Re-encrypt in background
          go s.migrateUserField(user.ID, "email", user.Email)
      }
      
      return user, nil
  }
  ```
- [ ] **Batch Migration** - Scheduled jobs for bulk re-encryption
  ```bash
  # Cron job: every Sunday at 2 AM
  0 2 * * 0 /app/scripts/migrate-encryption-keys.sh --batch-size=1000 --max-runtime=2h
  ```
- [ ] **Progress Tracking** - Migration status dashboard

#### **2.3 Key Usage Monitoring**
- [ ] **Prometheus Metrics** - Key version distribution metrics
  ```
  encryption_key_usage_total{version="1"} 1250
  encryption_key_usage_total{version="2"} 8900  
  encryption_key_usage_total{version="3"} 12500
  ```
- [ ] **Grafana Dashboard** - Visual key usage tracking
- [ ] **Alerting** - Notification when old key usage drops to zero

#### **2.4 Legacy Key Cleanup**
- [ ] **Cleanup Criteria** - When to remove old keys
  ```
  Remove key when:
  1. Zero data encrypted with that version (confirmed by audit)
  2. Key is older than 12 months
  3. At least 2 newer key versions exist
  4. Manual verification completed
  ```
- [ ] **Automated Cleanup** - Script to safely remove unused keys
- [ ] **Rollback Plan** - Emergency key restoration procedure

### Expected Outcomes
- **Reduced Memory Usage** - Fewer legacy keys in memory
- **Improved Security** - Regular key rotation without accumulation
- **Operational Visibility** - Clear metrics on encryption health

## üöÄ Phase 3: Advanced Features (FUTURE - 12+ months)

**Target Start**: 2025 Q3+  
**Expected Completion**: 2025 Q4 - 2026 Q1  
**Focus**: Enterprise features and vendor integration

### **3.1 AWS KMS Integration**
- [ ] **KMS Evaluation** - Cost/benefit analysis vs self-managed
- [ ] **Hybrid Implementation** - KMS for key management + local encryption
  ```go
  // Future architecture
  type KMSVersionedEncryptor struct {
      kmsClient   *kms.Client
      keyId       string
      localCache  map[string][]byte // Cache derived keys locally
  }
  ```
- [ ] **Migration Path** - Smooth transition from self-managed to KMS
- [ ] **Cost Optimization** - Key caching to minimize KMS API calls

### **3.2 Compliance & Reporting**
- [ ] **Audit Logging** - Complete key rotation audit trail
- [ ] **Compliance Reports** - Automated SOC2/ISO27001 evidence
- [ ] **Key Lifecycle Documentation** - Automated policy compliance
- [ ] **Security Metrics** - Encryption success rates, rotation cadence

### **3.3 Performance Optimization**
- [ ] **Key Derivation Caching** - Cache PBKDF2 results for performance
- [ ] **Batch Operations** - Encrypt/decrypt multiple fields efficiently
- [ ] **Hardware Security** - Evaluate HSM integration for high-security deployments

### **3.4 Advanced Security Features**
- [ ] **Key Escrow** - Secure key backup for compliance
- [ ] **Multi-Region Support** - Regional key isolation
- [ ] **Emergency Procedures** - Key compromise response automation
- [ ] **Security Monitoring** - Anomaly detection for encryption operations

## Success Metrics

### Phase 2 Targets
- **Migration Completion**: 95%+ of data using current key version
- **Performance Impact**: <1% degradation during migration
- **Legacy Keys**: Reduce to maximum 3 versions maintained
- **Monitoring Coverage**: 100% visibility into key usage

### Phase 3 Targets  
- **Compliance**: Automated evidence generation for audits
- **Security**: Zero key compromise incidents
- **Performance**: <100ms p95 latency for encryption operations
- **Cost**: Optimal balance between security and operational cost

## Risk Management

### Current Risks (Phase 1 Complete)
- ‚úÖ **Data Loss During Rotation**: ELIMINATED
- ‚úÖ **Service Downtime**: ELIMINATED  
- ‚úÖ **Backward Compatibility**: MAINTAINED

### Future Risks (Phases 2-3)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Migration Performance Impact**: Mitigated by background processing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Key Accumulation**: Addressed by cleanup automation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Complexity Growth**: Managed through monitoring and documentation

## Decision Points

### Phase 2 Go/No-Go Criteria
- [ ] Production system has been stable with versioned encryption for 3+ months
- [ ] Key rotation has completed successfully at least 2 times
- [ ] Monitoring shows consistent encryption performance
- [ ] Development team has bandwidth for migration project

### Phase 3 Go/No-Go Criteria
