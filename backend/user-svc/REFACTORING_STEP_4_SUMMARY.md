# Step 4: Refactoring Complete - Logical Separation

## Overview
Successfully refactored the codebase to reflect logical separation while preserving a single binary architecture with modular boundaries and unit-test isolation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `internal/auth` package
- **JWT Logic Migration**: Moved JWT/login logic from `internal/config` to `internal/auth`
  - `jwt_service.go`: Handles JWT token generation, validation, and configuration
  - `service.go`: Implements `AuthService` interface with authentication operations
  - `handler.go`: HTTP handlers for authentication endpoints
  - `router.go`: Authentication route registration

### 2. Created `internal/profile` package
- **Profile Service**: Split user profile operations into dedicated service
  - `service.go`: Implements `ProfileService` interface with profile and friend operations
  - `handler.go`: HTTP handlers for profile-related endpoints
  - `router.go`: Profile route registration

### 3. Enhanced `internal/onboarding` package
- **Router Addition**: Added `router.go` for onboarding route registration
- **Event Simplification**: Fixed circular dependency between events and onboarding packages

### 4. Updated Main Application (`main.go`)
- **Modular Services**: Initialize individual domain services instead of monolithic user service
- **Modular Routers**: Register separate routers for each domain (auth, profile, onboarding)
- **Clean Dependencies**: Removed circular dependencies and unused imports

### 5. Preserved Backward Compatibility
- **Unified Interface**: Created `service/unified_service.go` that combines all domain services
- **Legacy Support**: Existing handlers can still work with the unified interface if needed

## Architecture Benefits

### Modular Boundaries
- **Domain Separation**: Clear separation between authentication, profile, and onboarding concerns
- **Interface Contracts**: Each service has well-defined interfaces for testing and mocking
- **Dependency Management**: Reduced coupling between different business domains

### Unit Test Isolation
- **Service Testing**: Each service can be tested independently
- **Mock Interfaces**: Easy to mock individual services for testing
- **Domain Focus**: Tests can focus on specific business logic without cross-contamination

### Single Binary Preservation
- **Deployment Simplicity**: Still compiles to a single binary
- **Shared Resources**: Database connections and common utilities are shared
- **Configuration**: Centralized configuration management

## File Structure
```

├── auth/
│   ├── jwt_service.go    # JWT operations
│   ├── service.go        # AuthService implementation
│   ├── handler.go        # Auth HTTP handlers

│   └── ... (existing files)
└── service/
    └── unified_service.go # Backward compatibility layer
```

## API Routes Structure
- **Auth Routes**: `/api/v1/auth/*` (register, login, refresh, logout)
- **Profile Routes**: `/api/v1/users/*` (profile, friends, search)
- **Onboarding Routes**: `/api/v1/onboarding/*` (status, steps, preferences)

## Technical Improvements
- **Fixed JWT Compatibility**: Resolved JWT v5 API changes for token validation
- **Circular Dependency**: Fixed circular import between events and onboarding packages
- **Clean Imports**: Removed unused imports and resolved compilation issues
- **Type Safety**: Maintained strong typing across all interfaces

## Testing Ready
The refactored codebase is now ready for:
- **Unit Tests**: Each service can be tested in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Modular routers can be tested independently  
- **Mock Testing**: Clear interfaces for easy mocking
- **Performance Tests**: Individual service performance can be measured

This refactoring successfully achieves the goal of logical separation while maintaining deployment simplicity and enabling better testability and maintainability.
