# Chat Service & Business Logic Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation of Step 4: Service & Business Logic for the chat service.

## Overview

The implementation provides comprehensive service and business logic with Redis integration for real-time messaging, presence tracking, and unread count management.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files

1. **`internal/service/chat.go`** - Main service orchestrator
   - Coordinates all chat operations with Redis integration
   - Handles group vs direct conversation uniqueness
   - Validates participants and enforces business rules
   - Manages real-time fan-out via Redis publisher

2. **`internal/service/redis.go`** - Redis service for real-time features
   - Real-time event publishing for message fan-out
   - Presence tracking with TTL (Redis SET with 5-minute expiry)
   - Typing indicators with auto-expiry
   - Unread count management (Redis counters)
   - Online user tracking

### Modified Files

1. **`internal/model/models.go`** - Extended models for real-time features
   - Added presence tracking models (`UserPresence`, `PresenceStatus`)
   - Added real-time event models (`RealtimeEvent`, `RealtimeEventType`)
   - Added conversation with unread count model (`ConversationWithUnread`)
   - Added direct conversation model (`DirectConversation`)

2. **`internal/db/interfaces.go`** - Enhanced repository interfaces
   - Added direct conversation methods
   - Added unread count tracking methods
   - Enhanced conversation listing with unread counts

3. **`internal/db/conversation_repository.go`** - Implemented new interface methods
   - `CreateDirectConversation` - Creates direct 1-1 conversations
   - `GetDirectConversation` - Finds existing direct conversations (enforces uniqueness)
   - `ListConversationsWithUnread` - Returns conversations with real-time unread counts

4. **`internal/handler/chat_handler.go`** - Updated to use new service architecture

5. **`internal/service/chat_service.go`** - Enhanced with Redis integration and comprehensive validation

6. **`cmd/main.go`** - Updated to initialize new service orchestrator

7. **`go.mod`** - Added Redis dependency (`github.com/redis/go-redis/v9`)

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Service Orchestration
- **`internal/service/chat.go`** orchestrates all operations
- Separates concerns with specialized service components:
  - `ConversationService` - Manages conversations and memberships
  - `MessageService` - Handles messaging operations
  - `PresenceService` - Manages user presence and typing indicators

### 2. Participant Validation
- Validates participant uniqueness in group conversations
- Prevents self-conversation attempts
- Enforces membership requirements for all operations
- Validates room capacity and privacy settings

### 3. Group vs Direct Conversation Uniqueness
- **Group Conversations**: Created with explicit participant lists
- **Direct Conversations**: Enforced uniqueness between two participants
- Database queries ensure no duplicate direct conversations exist
- Hash-based approach ready for implementation for group conversation deduplication

### 4. Unread Count Management
- **Database Layer**: Persistent unread counts via `message_reads` table
- **Redis Layer**: Real-time unread counters with TTL (30 days)
- **Hybrid Approach**: Uses Redis for real-time updates, falls back to database
- Automatic increment when messages are sent (excludes sender)
- Reset when messages are marked as read

### 5. Redis Publisher for Real-time Fan-out
- **Room-based Publishing**: Events published to `room:{room_id}` channels
- **User-based Publishing**: Critical events also sent to `user:{user_id}` channels
- **Event Types**: New messages, user join/leave, typing indicators, presence updates
- **Automatic Broadcasting**: Messages automatically fan out to all room participants

### 6. Presence Tracking
- **Redis SET with TTL**: Users stored in `presence:online` set
- **Individual Presence**: Each user's detailed presence in `presence:{user_id}`
- **Auto-expiry**: 5-minute TTL ensures stale presence cleanup
- **Status Types**: Online, Away, Offline, Busy
- **Room Awareness**: Tracks which room user is currently active in

### 7. Additional Real-time Features
- **Typing Indicators**: Auto-expire after 10 seconds
- **Connection Management**: WebSocket connection tracking
- **Event Publishing**: Real-time events for UI updates
- **Health Monitoring**: Redis connectivity health checks

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. Scalability
- Redis pub/sub enables horizontal scaling
- Stateless service design
- Efficient caching with Redis

### 2. Reliability
- Graceful fallback from Redis to database
- Connection pooling and retry logic
- Proper error handling and logging

### 3. Real-time Performance
- Sub-second message delivery
- Efficient presence tracking
- Optimized unread count updates

### 4. Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive validation
- Well-structured service layers
- Extensive logging for debugging

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Group Conversation
```go
participants := []uuid.UUID{user2ID, user3ID}
room, err := service.GetConversationService().CreateGroupConversation(
    ctx, createReq, creatorID, participants)
```

### Creating a Direct Conversation
```go
room, err := service.GetConversationService().CreateDirectConversation(
    ctx, user1ID, user2ID)
```

### Sending a Message with Real-time Fan-out
```go
message, err := service.GetMessageService().SendMessage(
    ctx, messageReq, roomID, userID)
// Automatically publishes to Redis for real-time delivery
```

### Managing User Presence
```go
err := service.GetPresenceService().SetUserPresence(
    ctx, userID, model.PresenceOnline, &roomID)
```

### Getting Conversations with Unread Counts
```go
conversations, total, err := service.GetConversationService().
    GetConversationsWithUnread(ctx, userID, page, size)
```

## Dependencies Added

- `github.com/redis/go-redis/v9` - Redis client for Go

## Environment Variables

Redis configuration can be set via:
- `REDIS_HOST` (default: localhost)
- `REDIS_PORT` (default: 6379)
- `REDIS_PASSWORD` (default: empty)
- `REDIS_DB` (default: 0)
