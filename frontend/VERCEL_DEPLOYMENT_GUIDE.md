# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Guide: Availability Toggle Fix

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The availability toggle was failing on Vercel because:

1. **MSW Headers Issue**: The availability client was only adding the `X-User-ID` header when hostname was `localhost`
2. **Environment Variables**: Missing `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in demo environment configuration
3. **MSW Environment Detection**: Hostname-based restrictions preventing MSW from working on Vercel

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Availability Client (`src/services/availabilityClient.ts`)
- Removed hostname restriction for demo mode
- Added proper environment variable detection
- Added comprehensive debug logging

### 2. Updated Environment Configuration (`.env.demo`)
- Added `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://demo-api-placeholder.com`
- Ensures consistent API base URL across environments

### 3. Enhanced MSW Setup (`src/mocks/browser.ts` & `src/mocks/handlers.ts`)
- Improved environment detection for Vercel deployment
- Better error handling and logging
- More robust user ID extraction

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy the Updated Code
```bash
# The updated build is ready in the dist/ folder
# Deploy this to Vercel
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard
Go to your Vercel project settings and add these environment variables:

```
VITE_APP_MODE=demo
VITE_ENABLE_MOCKING=true
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://demo-api-placeholder.com
VITE_REQUIRE_AUTH=false
VITE_AUTO_LOGIN=true
VITE_MOCK_USER=true
VITE_SHOW_DEMO_BANNER=true
VITE_SEED_DEMO_DATA=true
```

### 3. Redeploy
After setting the environment variables, trigger a new deployment.

## 🐛 Debug Information

If the availability toggle still doesn't work, check the browser console for these debug messages:

### Expected MSW Startup Logs:
```
🔧 Main.tsx: Environment check: { ... }
🚀 Main.tsx: Loading MSW...
📦 Main.tsx: MSW module loaded, starting worker...
✅ Main.tsx: MSW started successfully
🔧 MSW: Mock Service Worker started successfully
```

### Expected Availability Request Logs:
```
🔄 AvailabilityClient: setUserAvailability called: { isAvailable: true }
🔐 AvailabilityClient: Token: present
🔧 AvailabilityClient: Added X-User-ID header for demo/dev mode: user-jane
📡 AvailabilityClient: Making request: { ... }
🔄 MSW: Availability PUT request received
🔄 MSW: Extracted userId: user-jane
🔄 MSW: Updated availability: { userId: "user-jane", is_available: true }
```

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### If MSW doesn't start:
1. Check that `mockServiceWorker.js` is in the deployed public folder
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Check browser console for MSW errors

### If requests aren't intercepted:
1. Ensure `VITE_ENABLE_MOCKING=true`
2. Check that requests are going to the correct API base URL
3. Look for CORS errors or network issues

### If user ID extraction fails:
1. Check that the user is properly authenticated
2. Verify the dev token format in localStorage
3. Look for X-User-ID header in network requests

## ✨ Expected Result

After deployment, the availability toggle should:
- ✅ Work on your Vercel domain
- ✅ Show debug logs in browser console
- ✅ Update the UI immediately
- ✅ Show success toast messages
- ✅ Persist the availability state

The MSW will intercept all API calls and handle them with mock data, so no real backend is needed for the demo.
