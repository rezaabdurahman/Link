## Screenshot Guidelines

When screenshots are added, they should:

- Be taken on modern devices (iPhone 14 Pro, iPad Pro, MacBook Pro)

- Demonstrate responsive behavior
- Include both light interactions and focus states
- Be optimized for web (WebP format recommended)
- Include accessible alt text in documentation
