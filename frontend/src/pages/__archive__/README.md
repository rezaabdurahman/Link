# Archived Pages

This directory contains pages that have been refactored to use the new state management system (Zustand stores) and modern React patterns.

## Archived Files

### Pre-Refactored Pages (Legacy State Management)
- `ChatPage.tsx` → Replaced by `ChatPageRefactored.tsx`
  - Used traditional useState hooks and direct API calls
  - Replaced with Zustand stores and SWR data fetching

- `FriendRequestsPage.tsx` → Replaced by `FriendRequestsPageRefactored.tsx`
  - Used traditional useState hooks and manual state management
  - Replaced with centralized friend requests store

- `ProfilePage.tsx` → Replaced by `ProfilePageRefactored.tsx`
  - Used local component state for profile management
  - Replaced with profile store and improved data flow

- `DiscoveryPageReference.tsx` → Reference implementation
  - Kept as reference for discovery page implementation patterns
  - Main `DiscoveryPage.tsx` incorporates modern state management

## Migration Notes

The refactored pages implement:
- **Zustand Stores**: Centralized state management
- **SWR Integration**: Automatic data fetching, caching, and revalidation
- **TypeScript Improvements**: Better type safety and inference
- **Performance Optimizations**: Reduced re-renders and improved loading states
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Unified error states across components

## Restoration

These files are archived and should not be restored to active use unless needed for reference. All new development should use the refactored versions that implement the current architecture patterns.
