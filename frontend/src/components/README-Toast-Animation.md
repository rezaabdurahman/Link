# Toast Animation Enhancement

## Overview
The Toast component now features enhanced transparency transition effects when appearing and disappearing, providing a smoother and more polished user experience.

## Enhanced Features

### 1. **Multi-Layer Transparency Transitions**
- **Background Color**: Dynamically transitions from 0% to 95% opacity
- **Text Content**: Smooth fade-in/fade-out for both icon and message text
- **Border**: Fades from 25% to 10% opacity during exit
- **Box Shadow**: Transitions from full shadow to subtle shadow during exit

### 2. **Improved Animation States**
```typescript
// Animation States
'entering' → 'visible' → 'exiting'

// Opacity Transitions
entering: 0% opacity (fully transparent)
visible:  100% opacity (fully opaque)  
exiting:  0% opacity (smooth fade-out)
```

### 3. **Enhanced Exit Animation**
- **Transform**: Subtle upward movement (-20px) with slight scale reduction (0.95)
- **Backdrop Filter**: Reduces blur from 20px to 10px during exit
- **Shadow**: Lighter shadow effect during exit for better visual hierarchy
- **Duration**: 400ms exit animation for smooth completion

### 4. **Transition Timing**
```css
/* Main container transitions */
all 0.4s cubic-bezier(0.175, 0.885, 0.32, 1.275)

/* Individual property transitions */
background-color 0.3s ease-out
backdrop-filter 0.3s ease-out  
box-shadow 0.3s ease-out
border 0.3s ease-out
opacity 0.3s ease-out (for text elements)
```

## Usage

The enhanced toast automatically appears when toggling the availability bar:

```typescript
// Triggered in DiscoveryPage when availability is toggled
const toggleAvailability = (): void => {
  const newAvailability = !isAvailable;
  setIsAvailable(newAvailability);
  
  const message = newAvailability 
    ? "You're now discoverable by others nearby" 
    : "You've been removed from the discovery grid";
  
  setToast({
    isVisible: true,
    message,
    type: 'success'
  });
};
```

## Visual Effects

### Entry Animation (50ms delay)
- Slides down from -100px with scale 0.8
- Fades in from 0% to 100% opacity
- Background, border, and shadow animate in smoothly

### Exit Animation (3000ms auto-dismiss + 400ms exit)
- Slides up slightly (-20px) with scale 0.95
- **Enhanced transparency fade-out** to 0% opacity
- Background color fades out smoothly
- Backdrop blur reduces for depth effect
- Shadow and border opacity decrease for subtle exit

## Benefits

1. **Smoother UX**: Enhanced transparency transitions feel more natural
2. **Visual Polish**: Multi-layer opacity changes create depth
3. **Reduced Jarring**: Gentler exit animation prevents abrupt disappearance
4. **Accessibility**: Smooth animations are easier on the eyes
5. **iOS-like Feel**: Matches native iOS notification behavior

## Technical Implementation

The enhancement uses separate opacity functions for different visual elements:

- `getBackgroundOpacity()`: Controls main container background
- `getTextOpacity()`: Controls icon and text fade transitions
- Dynamic backdrop-filter, box-shadow, and border adjustments based on animation state

This creates a layered animation effect where different elements fade at slightly different rates, providing a more sophisticated visual experience.
